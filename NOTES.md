### Components Folder structure

All the components folders contains 4 main files

1. index.ts file to export the component.
2. <Comp name>.tsx file -> component logic.
3. <Comp name>.test.tsx file -> component unit test.
4. style.css file -> component styles.

Used react context api to share state across the components
